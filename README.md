# Potato Disease Classification

Potato Disease Classification is a comprehensive machine learning project that aims to identify and classify diseases affecting potato plants. By leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, this project offers a web-based platform for farmers and agricultural enthusiasts to diagnose and manage potato plant diseases effectively.

## Features

- **Image Classification**: The core functionality of the project revolves around utilizing a pre-trained deep learning model to classify images of potato plants into various disease categories.
  
- **Real-Time Prediction**: Users can upload images of their potato plants through an intuitive web interface and receive instant predictions regarding the presence of diseases.

- **Multi-Class Classification**: The machine learning model is trained to classify potato plant images into multiple disease classes, allowing for accurate identification of various diseases simultaneously.

- **Scalable Architecture**: The project is built using scalable technologies such as FastAPI for the backend and React for the frontend, ensuring efficient handling of user requests and smooth user experience.

## Technologies Used

### Backend

- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python.
  
- **TensorFlow**: An open-source machine learning framework for building, training, and deploying deep learning models.
  
- **Keras**: A high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, for easy and fast prototyping of deep learning models.

### Frontend

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications.
